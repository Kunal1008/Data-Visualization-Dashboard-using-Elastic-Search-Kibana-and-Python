# Data-Visualization-Dashboard-using-Elastic-Search-Kibana-and-Python

This mini project builds a dashboard for data visualization in order to perform exploratory data analysis of the Loan Prediction problem.Python is used to read data and insert data into Elasticsearch for creating visualizations through Kibana.

Elastic Search (ES)
Elastic Search is an open source, RESTful distributed and scalable search engine. Elastic search is extremely fast in fetching results for simple or complex queries on large amounts of data (Petabytes) because of itâ€™s simple design and distributed nature. It is also much easier to work with than a conventional database constrained by schemas, tables.Elastic Search provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents.

Kibana
Kibana is an open source data exploration and visualization tool built on Elastic Search to help you understand data better. It provides visualization capabilities on top of the content indexed on an Elasticsearch cluster. Users can create bar, line and scatter plots, or pie charts and maps on top of large volumes of data.
